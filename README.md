# 💾 Discord Chat Archive - [HERE](https://lubrj.github.io/expose/)

## 📌 What is this?  
This repository contains a **large collection of gathered Discord chats**.

## 🎯 Why?  
Because this kind of work has **helped people in the past** and, honestly, it’s just fun.

## 🔢 What are these numbers?  
They’re **Discord user IDs**.  
If you don’t know what that is — Google it, skid.

## ⚖️ Morality Statement  
I have **no regrets** uploading these.  
They come from **people who intended to dox others**, so I’m not losing sleep over it.

## 🗂 Legacy Files  
- **Legacy files** are from our **old workflow**.  
- They’re **no longer supported**.  
- They might have **data loss** and **different naming formats**.

## 🛠 How it’s done  
The exact process stays secret, but I used:  
- **Discord Chat Exporter** (Linux CLI)  
- **Python automation tools**  
- **A Discord bot** to receive payloads
